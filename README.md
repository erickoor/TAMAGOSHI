# Tamagoshi-Practice
### Simple Tamagoshi Game

I decided to create a simple copy of the tamagoshi game using python to consolidate my learning with the language.
The initial idea was just to practice OOP, but as I was developing the project I started to increase some extra functions.
I created a simple save system through a .txt file, I made a simple treading scheme to make the pet's life decrease while other functions are executed.
vou descrever algumas das funcionalidades que j√° implementei e as que ainda pretendo implementar.

* Save System - It was quite challenging to create this system through the txt file (ready to use!).
* Concurrent execution for the pet's life - As the game runs, your life decreases.
* Game Menu - Implementation of the menu for the game, still incomplete.
* Pet status - You can see information such as hunger, health and mood.
* Hunger and Mood Count - Implemented the same health count system for hunger and mood.
* Feeding System: done but still needs some tweaking.

For now, these are the features I've created so far. I still intend to create the games that allowed you to play with the pet.
I intend to create games like rock-paper-scissors, hangman and maybe a tic-tac-toe game

I'm also with the idea of creating some combat system, where you put your pet to battle against others. But it's something I'm still wondering if I'm going to do.

That's it for now, hope to be back soon with more updates.
